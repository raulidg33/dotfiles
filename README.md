# Dotfiles

Here lie the configuration files for my macOS setup.

## Usage

Did you really forget how to use your own dotfiles? Really??

Well, here it goes...

Clone this repository into your User folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/raulidg33/dotfiles.git
```

Then run the installation script:
```
# enter scripts folder
cd scripts/

# make script executable
sudo chmod +x install.sh

# run install.sh
./install.sh
```

And you are done!
