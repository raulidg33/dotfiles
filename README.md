# Fucking Dotfiles

Here lie the configuration files for my macOS setup

## Usage

You Idiot, did you really forget how to use your own fucking dotfiles?

Well, here it goes.

clone this fucking repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/raulidg33/dotfiles.git
```

Then run the installation script. Oh wait, there's no script yet. Either you wait or you figure it out on your own...
